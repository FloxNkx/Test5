Next day, they picked up my car and I met a friendly concierge who explained all the options and steps. I chose to have the entire hood, front bumper, head lights, front fenders, side mirrors, front pillars, rear bumper, door edges and the rocker panels covered with PPF. They returned it two days later and the car looked 100% better than the day I picked it up at the Tesla showroom. WOW! I might return to do chrome delete. Cannot recommend this place enough!`,
